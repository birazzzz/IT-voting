# Solution Summary: Fixing Supabase "Table Not Found" Error

## Problem Analysis

The "Candidates table not found in Supabase" error was actually caused by **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies, not because the tables didn't exist. The tables were created correctly, but Supabase's security settings were preventing access.

## How to Fix the Issue

### Quick Start (Recommended)
1. Run `npm run setup` to initialize the setup process
2. Follow the interactive guide in your browser
3. Create tables and configure RLS policies as instructed

### Manual Steps
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Create the `candidates` and `votes` tables with the required schema
3. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for both tables
4. Create SELECT policies with `true` as the USING expression
5. For the votes table, also create an INSERT policy with `true` as the WITH CHECK expression

## Updated Error Handling

I've also updated all HTML files to provide better error messages:
- **[admin.html](file:///Users/birazzz/Mega/Leada/voting/admin.html)** - Enhanced RLS error detection
- **[voting.html](file:///Users/birazzz/Mega/Leada/voting/voting.html)** - Improved error messages
- **[leaderboard.html](file:///Users/birazzz/Mega/Leada/voting/leaderboard.html)** - Better error handling
- **[dashboard.html](file:///Users/birazzz/Mega/Leada/voting/dashboard.html)** - Enhanced diagnostics

## New npm Scripts

You can now use these convenient commands:
- `npm run setup` - Initialize setup process
- `npm run supabase:dashboard` - Open Supabase dashboard
- `npm run supabase:guide` - Open setup guide
- `npm run supabase:test` - Open testing page

## Why This Fixes the Issue

The root cause was that Supabase enables security by default, which is great for production but requires explicit configuration for anonymous access. The error messages were misleading because they suggested tables didn't exist when they actually did exist but weren't accessible due to RLS policies.

With proper RLS configuration, your application will now work correctly with real-time global data synchronization as intended.
